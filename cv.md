## *Summury:*
 I have worked for 5 years in an online store as a sales manager. And now I decided to change the field of my activity and try something new. I like coding and I can spend a lot of time doing what interests me. I like to communicate with interesting people, work in a team, overcome difficulties. I hope all this will help me to become a frontend developer in the future.
